## Project Outline :

1. **Project Setup and Environment Configuration**:
    - Set up your development environment as before.
    - Install necessary tools and libraries, including the LLM.

2. **Database Design and Schema**:
    - Extend your database schema to include tables for storing LLM-related data (e.g., recommendations, code analysis results).

3. **User Authentication and Authorization**:
    - Ensure that users can authenticate and access personalized features.

4. **Question Data Collection and Storage**:
    - Collect coding questions (as discussed earlier).
    - Store additional metadata related to each question, such as tags and difficulty levels.

5. **Integration of Open-Source LLM (e.g., StarCoder)**:
    - **StarCoder** is an excellent choice for code analysis and recommendations ‚Åµ.
    - Integrate StarCoder into your backend using its API or Python library.
    - Use StarCoder to analyze user-submitted code, identify patterns, and provide suggestions.
    - For example:
        - When a user submits a solution, pass it to StarCoder for analysis.
        - StarCoder can identify potential improvements, highlight inefficiencies, and suggest alternative approaches.

6. **Recommendation Engine Enhancement**:
    - Leverage StarCoder's capabilities to enhance your recommendation engine:
        - **Similar Solutions**: Recommend questions with similar solutions based on code patterns.
        - **Optimal Approaches**: Suggest optimal approaches for specific problem types.
        - **Code Refactoring**: Recommend refactoring techniques for existing code.
        - **Common Mistakes**: Warn users about common mistakes in their solutions.

7. **Methods to Solve Coding Questions**:
    - Here are three effective methods for solving coding questions:

    a. **Brute Force Approach**:
        - Start with the simplest solution.
        - Solve the problem directly without optimization.
        - Useful for understanding the problem and getting a working solution.
        - Example (JavaScript):
          ```javascript
          function addNumbers(a, b) {
              return a + b;
          }
          ```

    b. **Divide and Conquer**:
        - Break down the problem into smaller subproblems.
        - Solve each subproblem recursively.
        - Combine the results to get the final solution.
        - Commonly used for problems like binary search, merge sort, and quicksort.

    c. **Dynamic Programming**:
        - Identify overlapping subproblems.
        - Store intermediate results in a table (memoization).
        - Use these results to build the final solution.
        - Suitable for problems with optimal substructure (e.g., Fibonacci sequence, longest common subsequence).

8. **Frontend Integration**:
    - Display LLM-generated recommendations alongside questions.
    - Provide users with insights from code analysis.
    - Allow users to accept or modify LLM suggestions.

9. **Testing and Debugging**:
    - Test LLM integration thoroughly.
    - Handle edge cases and unexpected LLM behavior.

10. **Documentation and Deployment**:
    - Document LLM usage, endpoints, and integration details.
    - Deploy your enhanced application.
